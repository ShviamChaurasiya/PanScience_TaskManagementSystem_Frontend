## Setup & Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/task-management-frontend.git
   cd task-management-frontend
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
Configure API base URL:

In /src/api/axios.js, update the baseURL to point to your backend API.

Start the development server:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm run dev
The app will be available at http://localhost:3000 (or the port Vite configures).

Available Scripts
npm run dev - Runs the app in development mode with hot reloading.

npm run build - Builds the app for production.

npm run preview - Locally preview the production build.

Authentication
Uses JWT tokens stored in React context (not in localStorage for security).

Tokens are sent in Authorization header on API requests.

On login, user info and token are saved in context.

On logout, user info and token are cleared.

Routing
/register - User registration page

/login - User login page

/dashboard - Authenticated user dashboard showing tasks and user info

Protected routes redirect unauthenticated users to login.

API Integration
Uses Axios instance configured to connect with backend API.

Handles errors and shows messages on UI.

Task management integrates with backend endpoints.

State Management
Uses React Context API (AuthContext) for auth state.

Local component states handle forms and UI states.

Dashboard and tasks update state based on API responses.

Styling
Tailwind CSS is used for responsive and utility-first styling.

Consistent design with simple, clean UI.
